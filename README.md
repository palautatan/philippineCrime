visualizing crime in the Philippines for awareness

# Introduction
In my Chicano Studies class, I was asked fervently a question rephrased multiple ways, but clearly asking this: "Why are you doing what you're doing in college if you're not giving back to where your efforts were intended in the first place?"

My parents came to the United States from the Philippines. Plenty of students like me are the children of immigrants trying to prove that our parents' sacrifices were well worth it. Our parents give back to the Philippines and call it "home". At least for myself, I call the Philippines "home" as well, and I'm sure this is true for plenty of Filipino-Americans. This is called "imaginative love" in the words of Marilynne Robinson.

# Data
These data were taken from the Philippines Open Data Portal. The population dataset has been reformatted. I will enumerate my pipeline process sometime in 2017.

# Goals
What I mean to understand through visualizing crime in the Philippines is the Philippines itself. This is not to say the Philippines is a crime-stricken country with no other depth. I just think this will help me understand the land mass of islands on the level that is crime. Hopefully, I can compare some areas I learn about with areas that I've been in like my hometowns of San Francisco, Daly City, and Davis, CA.

This comparison will hopefully lead to more interesting discoveries, given that data on the Philippines is available. However, after simply searching the web, I'm sure Philippine data is not ample.
